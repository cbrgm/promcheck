# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Your participation is vital in shaping and improving it. Here's an expanded guide to help you get involved effectively:

## Introduction üåü

- **Getting Started**: Browse our [Feature Requests](#feature-requests), [Bug Reports](#bug-reports), [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), and [Writing Documentation](#writing-documentation) sections to find ways you can contribute.
- **Questions or Suggestions?** Feel free to reach out via email at <mailto:github@cbrgm.net>.

## Feature Requests üöÄ

Interested in adding a feature? Look through the ***[existing feature requests](https://github.com/cbrgm/promcheck/issues)*** first. If your idea is new, submit a ***feature request issue*** explaining the feature's benefits and relevance to this project.

## Bug Reports üêõ

If you encounter a bug, please first verify if it's already known by checking the ***[open bugs](https://github.com/cbrgm/promcheck/issues)***. To report a new bug, ***open an issue*** with these specifics:

- **Description**: Briefly describe the issue.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detail how we can recreate the bug.
- **Expected vs. Actual Results**: Contrast what should happen with what actually occurs.
- **Version Info**: Specify the version you're using.

Providing clear, detailed information accelerates the bug-fixing process.

## Pull Requests üí°

Contributions via Pull Requests (PRs) are highly encouraged. To contribute:

- **Check Existing PRs**: Before starting, look at ***[existing pull requests](https://github.com/cbrgm/promcheck/pulls)***. Collaborating on existing efforts can be more impactful.
- **Minor Improvements & Tests**: For small changes or adding tests, submit PRs anytime. Ensure your changes are well-tested.
- **Code Review Process**: Expect your PRs to be thoroughly reviewed. We assume responsibility for your contributions once merged and appreciate ongoing maintenance from your side.

## Collaborating ü§ù

- **Be Responsive**: Engage with any feedback and reviews on your contributions.
- **Small, Focused Commits**: Break your contributions into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Testing**: Verify that your contribution passes all tests.
- **Respectful Interaction**: Remember, collaboration is key. Treat others with respect and patience.

## Additional Contributions üé®

- **Documentation**: Contributions to improve documentation are always welcome.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Suggest or implement enhancements to existing features.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: For serious security issues, email me directly at github@cbrgm.net . Otherwise, a PR is a faster approach.

## Collaborator Status üåà

- **Becoming a Collaborator**: If your PR is merged, congratulations! You might be granted "collaborator status", allowing more direct involvement in the project.
- **Responsibilities**: Collaborators are expected to review PRs, submit new ones, and resolve issues. We ask for thorough code reviews and courteous interaction with new contributors.
- **Inactive Collaborators**: Inactivity may lead to a temporary removal of collaborator status for security reasons, with the possibility of reinstatement later.

## Final Notes üìö

Your contributions are what make this project thrive. We look forward to your ideas, bug reports, code contributions, and documentation updates. Let's continue to build and improve this project together!
